When I was 5 or 6 my dad bought me a computer and since then it was my best friend.
Learning about computers is not about getting a job for me. Its just a way to know more about a dear friend.
I am passionate about learning and I wish to learn almost every aspect of this vast field.
And hopefully I will be able to achieve that goal while making a living out of my hobby.
